# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## A webpage designed for bootcamp students to learn and utilize the cornerstones of webpage development using HTML, Git, CSS, and JavaScript. The act of creating this webpage in the progress of learning about the topics, made it that much more interactive. I learned to use these different features and programs/programming languages together in tandem to achieve expected results.

Opening this webpage and opening the DevTools console beside it will show the topics that are able to be learned from the prework. The console will choose a topic for us to study first from the list of topics.
